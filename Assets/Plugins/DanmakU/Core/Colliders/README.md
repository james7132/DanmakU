#Colliders

This folder contains a number of classes that derive from `DanmakuCollider` (and in turn `IDanmakuCollider`).

`IDanmakuCollider` is the only way to add collision event handling with fired bullets in DanmakU. This Colliders folder provides a few pre-created ones that may be very useful.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/Rhythmia/DanmakU/wiki/Danmaku-Colliders) on Danmaku Colliders for more information.
